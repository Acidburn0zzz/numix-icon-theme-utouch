Numix uTouch 3 icon theme
==============
Numix uTouch is an icon theme from the [Numix project](http://numixproject.org). This theme is was a form of LTS - it would have not receive updates anywhere as frequently as Circle or Square but it would still receive the occasional update to keep it up to date. Now [DevilishDB](http://devilishdb.deviantart.com) is maintaining it. Otherwise it would've been axed when it lost popularity.

Licensed under the GPL-3.0 or any newer version (at your option).

### Installation for the current version (uTouch 2)
If you still want to use uTouch 2 on Ubuntu or any of it's derivatives (including Mint and elementary OS) you can use our Numix PPA. Fire up a Terminal and run the following:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:numix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install numix-icon-theme-utouch
```

When it's done you will be able to get uTouch 3 either from deviantART or GitHub, there might also be a repo.

### Icon Requests
For icon requests, email [85929f16@opayq.com](mailto:85929f16@opayq.com). Note: this is a masked email address and will forward emails to me, so that I don't have to disclose my real email address.

### Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script that Numix also covers can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/blob/master/data/themes/numix.md). This may not be available for uTouch 3 at the moment.
